Computing Applications in Mechatronics Systems
The aim of this course is to implement software for vehicle simulation and control. The previously acquired C/C++ programming and control systems knowledge is used to develop user interfaces, simulations models and control algorithms for the control of vehicles including car-like robotic vehicles, tracked vehicles such as bulldozers and four-wheel-steer and four-wheel-drive vehicles. Kinematic and/or dynamic models of these vehicles will be used in developing simulation models. In addition, the course will also teach the interfacing of data acquisition systems, motion control systems, sensors such as inertial sensors, GPS sensors, laser sensors and encoders to facilitate sensing and actuation. The course has an extensive experimental content where the above developed software will be used to control either a tracked vehicle or a wheeled vehicle.
